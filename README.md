# Code-quiz
In this challenge, I created a code quiz where each student is to answer each question within an alloted time. If the student fails a question, time is deducted from the total time alloted. 
No starter code was given for this challenge.

## Description

The goal of this project is to create a timed quiz application where users are able to take a quiz within an alloted time that stores the scores.

## Installation

This page was accomplished with technologies such as React. In order to add features to the application, I worked on adding features in the component folder of my react. I also utilised react icons. I utilized Tailwind which is a css library as well in order to create the application.


## Usage
User is able to start the quiz by clicking on button of the first question which starts the timer.
User is presented with questions. 
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```

Below, are screenshots of how my web application currently looks like:
